# Flu-Season
  
Created By: Sahil Katrekar, Darren Lim, Justin Lin, Vivek Mogili  

## Description  
The season of sickness is here! Infected children are coming into your hospital in droves. You are a hospital nurse curing infected kids with launchable vaccines. You donâ€™t want to get too close to the kids as the diseases are highly contagious. The game itself is like a zombie invasion style top down shooter, but you help treat children instead! For you to win, you must first treat 10 waves of infected kids. Then, you must face off against a final boss.  
  
## How To Play
W A S D to move, mouse to look around, mouse left click to shoot, space to dodge (only when not in invincibility frames), Q or E to switch weapons.
